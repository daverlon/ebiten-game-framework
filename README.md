<br>
<p>This is a for-fun project I am working on with the goal of making future 2D game prototyping/development easy and fun.</p>
<br>
<p>This framework uses a custom scene-stack system focused around isolating each scene's scope and logic. It also contains a custom camera system and sprite/entity management system. It contains a few demo scenes to test various functionality.</p>
